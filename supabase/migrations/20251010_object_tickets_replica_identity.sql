-- Enable REPLICA IDENTITY FULL for object_tickets table
-- This ensures that realtime UPDATE events include ALL columns in the "old" payload,
-- not just the primary key. This is critical for detecting when tickets move between buildings.

-- Change replica identity to FULL
ALTER TABLE object_tickets REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
